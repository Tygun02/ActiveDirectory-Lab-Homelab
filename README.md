# 🖥️ Active Directory Homelab (Windows Server)

This repository documents my hands-on **Active Directory (AD) homelab** project.  
I built a Windows Server domain controller in a VMware environment and configured a full AD setup with **OUs, users, groups, GPOs, and security policies**.

📌 **Key Highlights**
- ⚙️ Built a Windows Server 2022 VM and promoted it to a **Domain Controller**  
- 🌐 Configured **DNS and networking** for domain services  
- 🗂️ Designed a structured **OU hierarchy** (IT, HR, Sales)  
- 👥 Automated **user and group creation** with PowerShell  
- 🔒 Applied **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** for password complexity & security baselines  
- 📑 Exported **GPO reports and backups** for documentation
